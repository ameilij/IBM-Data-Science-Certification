To analyze the data using SQL, it first needs to be stored in the database.\n\nWhile it is easier to read the dataset into a Pandas dataframe and then PERSIST it into the database as we saw in the previous lab, it results in mapping to default datatypes which may not be optimal for SQL querying. For example a long textual field may map to a CLOB instead of a VARCHAR.\n\nTherefore, **it is highly recommended to manually load the table using the database console LOAD tool, as indicated in Week 2 Lab 1 Part II**. The only difference with that lab is that in Step 5 of the instructions you will need to click on create \"(+) New Table\" and specify the name of the table you want to create and then click \"Next\".\n\n##### Now open the Db2 console, open the LOAD tool, Select / Drag the .CSV file for the CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS dataset and load the dataset into a new table called **SCHOOLS**.\n\n<a href=\"https://cognitiveclass.ai/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDB0201ENSkillsNetwork20127838-2022-01-01\"><img src = \"https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/uc4xjh1uxcc78ks1i18v668simioz4es.jpg\"></a>\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Connect to the database\n\nLet us now load the ipython-sql  extension and establish a connection with the database\n\nThe following modules are pre-installed in the Skills Network Labs environment.
