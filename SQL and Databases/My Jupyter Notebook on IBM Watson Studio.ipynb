RStudio\n2. Jupyter Lab for Python notebooks\n3. Julia\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome people ask me about my preference for DS languajes. I have some opinions but I think you should use whatever gets the job done and you love using.\n\n> I have long refrained from languaje wars and OS wars. I love R and Python in equal measure, but I am new to Julia. \n\nI also enjoy using Windows, Mac and Linux in equal measure.
